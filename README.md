## Welcome to SlicerMorph Project 

The goal of this NSF funded project is to extend the functionality of the 3D-Slicer biomedical visualization suite with tools that will help  biologists working with 3D specimen data. The toolkit will enable biologists to retrieve, visualize, measure and annotate high-resolution specimen data both from volumetric scans (CTs and MRs) as well as from 3D surface scanners effectively within 3D-Slicer. 

In addition to developing this toolkit, we will organize a week-long intense summer workshop that will cover fundamentals of 3D image processing and segmentation, and other related techniques relevant to conducting 3D quantitative morphology studies. Our first summer workshop is planned for **August 25th thru Sept 1st, 2019** at the [University of Washington Friday Harbor Laboratories](https://fhl.uw.edu/). Information about the application process and course contents will be available Spring 2019 on this site. 

## Where to begin?
If you are not familiar with the 3D-Slicer or looking for a free (and open-source) alternative commercial 3D visualization programs, you can start by downloading it from [https://download.slicer.org](https://download.slicer.org). 3D-Slicer website provides [a plethora of documentation (https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/Training)]. For use cases that involve high-resolution non-clinical datasets, you can look at these tutorials. More will be added along the way.
