## Welcome to SlicerMorph Project 

The goal of this NSF funded project is to extend the functionality of the 3D-Slicer biomedical visualization suite with tools that will help  biologists working with 3D specimen data. The toolkit will enable biologists to retrieve, visualize, measure and annotate high-resolution specimen data both from volumetric scans (CTs and MRs) as well as from 3D surface scanners effectively within 3D-Slicer. 

In addition to developing this toolkit, we will organize a week-long intense summer workshop that will cover fundamentals of 3D image processing and segmentation, and other related techniques relevant to conducting 3D quantitative morphology studies. Our first summer workshop is planned for **August 25th thru Sept 1st, 2019** at the [University of Washington Friday Harbor Laboratories](https://fhl.uw.edu/). Information about the application process and course contents will be available Spring 2019 on this site. 

## Where to begin?
If you are not familiar with the 3D-Slicer or looking for a free (and open-source) alternative to commercial 3D visualization programs, you can start by downloading it from [https://download.slicer.org](https://download.slicer.org). 3D-Slicer website provides [a plethora of documentation](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/Training). For use cases that involve high-resolution, non-clinical datasets, you can look at these following tutorials. More will be added along the way. 

1. [A detailed example of showcasing existing functionality in 3D-Slicer.](https://blogs.uw.edu/maga/2017/04/a-worked-example-getting-and-visualizing-data-from-digimorph/)
2. [Obtaining 3D image stacks from MorphoSource and processing them in 3D-Slicer.](https://blogs.uw.edu/maga/2017/04/morphosource-data-and-dealing-with-dicom-series-in-slicer/)
3. [How to exchange complex projects with colleagues.](https://blogs.uw.edu/maga/2018/09/saving-and-exchanging-data-with-slicer/)

For general Slicer related questions, you can seek help from the online Slicer community through the [forum](https://discourse.slicer.org). Please make sure to look at the [Frequently Asked Questions about Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/FAQ) before posting. 

## Where to find 3D specimen data?
If you are looking for sample 3D specimen data, these repositories are good places to start. Feel free to contact us if you are aware of other large 3D specimen repositories.
1. [MorphSource](https://www.morphosource.org): MorphoSource is a project-based data archive that allows researchers to store and organize, share, and distribute their own 3d data.
2. [DigiMorph](https://www.digimorph.org): Digital Morphology library is a dynamic archive of information on digital morphology and high-resolution X-ray computed tomography of biological specimens.
3. [FaceBase](https://www.facebase.org): Comprehensive craniofacial data (including 3D imaging datasets) from model organisms (mouse and zebrafish) and humans. 
4. [MorphoBrowser](http://morphobrowser.biocenter.helsinki.fi/):‘MorphoBrowser’ database and interface is a 3D visualisation and searching tool for mammalian teeth, accessible over the web.
5. [Phenome10K](http://phenome10k.org/): A free online repository for 3-D scans of biological and palaeontological specimens.
6. [Genetics of craniofacial shape in Mus](https://osf.io/w4wvg/): High-resolution 3D microCT head scans of a mouse panel between C57BL/6J and A/J mouse strains and associated genotype data. Contains mCT scans of ~500 mice heads and associated cranial landmarks. 
7. [Digital Morphology Museum of Kyoto University (KUPRI)](http://dmm4.pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dmm/WebGallery/index.html): DMM provides a large collection of CT and MRI tomography scans of various primates. 

## Data Dropbox
We are looking for sample data from diverse set of organisms (and scales) to test our package. It will be greatly helpful, if you can donate sample data for different organisms, and especially for 3D modalities apart from CT/microCT. The public data drop folder is located at [https://faculty.washington.edu/maga/data_dropbox/](https://faculty.washington.edu/maga/data_dropbox/). Please do provide a brief description of the dataset and your e-mail. If you have multiple files (e.g., image stacks, associated landmarks, segmentations, etc.), please zip them as a single file. If you send us any data in proprietary formats (Amira, Avizo, Geomagick, etc.), please provide us with a description of the format so that we can research ways of converting them into an open format correctly and publish the workflow for the benefit of the community.
