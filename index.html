<h2>Welcome to SlicerMorph Project</h2>
<p>The goal of this NSF funded project is to extend the functionality of the <a href="https://download.slicer.org"> 3D-Slicer biomedical visualization suite </a> with tools that will help biologists working with 3D specimen data. The toolkit will enable biologists to retrieve, visualize, measure and annotate high-resolution specimen data both from volumetric scans (CTs and MRs) as well as from 3D surface scanners effectively within 3D-Slicer.</p>
<p>In addition to developing this toolkit, we will organize a week-long intense summer workshop that will cover fundamentals of 3D image processing and segmentation, and other related techniques relevant to conducting 3D quantitative morphology studies. Our first summer workshop is planned for <strong>August 25th thru Sept 1st, 2019</strong> at the <a href="https://fhl.uw.edu/" rel="nofollow">University of Washington Friday Harbor Laboratories</a>. Information about the application process and course contents will be available Spring 2019 on this site.</p>

<h2>Where to begin?</h2>
<p>If you are not familiar with the 3D-Slicer or looking for a free (and open-source) alternative to commercial 3D visualization programs, you can start by downloading it from <a href="https://download.slicer.org" rel="nofollow">https://download.slicer.org</a>. 3D-Slicer website provides <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/Training" rel="nofollow">a plethora of documentation</a>. For use cases that involve high-resolution, non-clinical datasets, you can look at these following tutorials. More will be added along the way.</p>

  <h2>Sample Datasets to test SlicerMorph</h2>
  We have couple 3D landmark datasets that you can use to test SlicerMorph. Sample Data can be found at <a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SampleData/"> https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SampleData</a>
  
  <h2>Data Dropbox</h2>
<p>We are looking for sample data from diverse set of organisms (and scales) to test our package. It will be greatly helpful, if you can donate sample data for different organisms, and especially for 3D modalities apart from CT/microCT. The public data drop folder is located at <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/maga/data_dropbox/" rel="nofollow">https://faculty.washington.edu/maga/data_dropbox/</a>. Please do provide a brief description of the dataset and your e-mail. If you have multiple files (e.g., image stacks, associated landmarks, segmentations, etc.), please zip them as a single file. If you send us any data in proprietary formats (Amira, Avizo, Geomagick, etc.), please provide us with a description of the format so that we can research ways of converting them into an open format correctly and publish the workflow for the benefit of the community.</p>
